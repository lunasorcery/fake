# Fake

_like Make, but not_.

## Frequently Asked Questions
[faq]: #faq

### What?
[what]: #what
Fake is a modern, open-source build system, largely inspired by Make, but with a few key differences.

### Why?
[why]: #why
Because apparently everyone else has written their own build system and I didn't want to be left out.

### How do I configure Fake?
[configuration]: #configuration
Build configuration is provided via a Fakefile, as you might expect. It's assumed that by using Fake, you know what you're doing, so documentation is neither necessary or available. You'll figure it out.

### How do I build Fake?
[building]: #building
Sadly, Fake is not yet self-hosting, so for now it builds using Make. Hopefully you know how to use that.

### Does it support Windows?
[windows]: #windows
No.

### Can it actually build things?
[wip]: #wip
We're working on it.

### What's the license?
[license]: #license
Fake is distributed under the terms of the WTFPL. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more details.

### Is just this another silly joke you've really over-committed to?
